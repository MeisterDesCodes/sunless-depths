description = "You awaken in darkness, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and decay. Your head throbs with a dull ache, and your mind is shrouded in fog. Memories slip through your fingers like water, leaving only a void where your past should be.

Alone in the midst of winding tunnels, you sense the weight of isolation pressing down upon you. But amidst the uncertainty, one thought pierces through the haze: you must find refuge, and quickly.

With no recollection of how you arrived here or who you are, your instinct drives you forward. There is safety in the underground settlements, bastions of humanity in a world overrun by shadows and unknown horrors. Your mission is clear: navigate these ancient sewers, overcome the perils that lurk in the darkness, and find sanctuary among the survivors.
Time is of the essence. The journey ahead is fraught with danger, but you must press on. Your survival depends on it."
