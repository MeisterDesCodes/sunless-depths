description = "Blackness fades as you regain consciousness. You awaken in nearly complete darkness, merely the cinders of a dying campfire shed some light. 

You slowly lift youself up, leaning with one arm on the cave walls to keep your shaky feet from collapsing.Your head feels unnaturally heavy, dragging you down with every step you take.

As you try to concentrate on a name, location or day, you realize that you can't remember a thing. Like in a distant dream, thoughts fade away just before you can get a hold on them.

Instead, just a simple question enters your mind. \"How did I get here?\""
